This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/SeparationMaterialSelector.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# PRIVATE GITHUB PACKAGE

`Veridibloc` packages are private. 

## Local Development

Create a file `.npmrc` in the root folder"

```bash
touch .nvmrc

```
And copy the following content. `<GHP_TOKEN>` needs to be replaced by the (classic) Private Access Token with at least `read:repo` scope

```
; Use NPM registry by default
//registry.npmjs.org/

; GitHub Packages registry for your org's packages
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<GHP_TOKEN>
@veridibloc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Vercel

In vercel create a _shared_ environment variable named `NPM_RC` and copy the content from `.npmrc` into it.
Then assign this env var to all your projects that uses the package.
